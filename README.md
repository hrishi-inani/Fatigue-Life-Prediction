# Fatigue-Life-Prediction

This project presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning (ML) models for predicting the fatigue cycle of additively manufactured materials. Five ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and KNN, were employed to model fatigue behaviour, with their predictive performance assessed using the R² and visual inspection of predicted versus experimental values. Additionally, feature importance analysis was conducted to identify influential attributes in predicting fatigue life values. The results highlight variations in predictive accuracy among the ML models and provide insights into the relative importance of different attributes. This study contributes to advancing fatigue prediction methodologies for additively manufactured materials and informs material design and processing optimization efforts to enhance component durability and reliability.

## Result

The variability in R² values highlights differences in the models' abilities to explain the variance in fatigue cycle predictions. Models with higher R² values demonstrate stronger correlations between predicted and actual values, indicating superior predictive performance.
